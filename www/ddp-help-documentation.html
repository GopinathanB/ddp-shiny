<p><span style="font-size:xx-large;">Usage Notes</span>:
<br/><span style="font-size:larger;">Providing input</span>:
  <ul>
    <li>The first slider on the left allows you to provide the dose of the drug (in milligrams - mg) provided to the subject. Range = 265 to 325 mg, in steps of 0.1 mg. Default = 315 mg.</li>
    <li>The second slider on the left allows you to indicate the number of hours that have passed since the dose was given to the subject. Range = 0 to 24 hours, in steps of 1/2 hour. Default = 4 hours</li>
  </ul>
  &nbsp;
<br/><span style="font-size:larger;">Observing output</span>:  
<ul>
  <li>The first line of output shows the input provided.</li>
  <li>A plot of the data values are shown as indicated. X-axis is the time since the dose was provided, and Y-axis is the drug concentration for 6 subjects in mg/L.<br/>The blue line indicates a linear fit, and the red line indicates the hours provided as input.</li>
  <li>The prediction from the model is also shown (units = mg/L).</li>
</ul>
